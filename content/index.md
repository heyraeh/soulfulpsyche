# OHAI 👋🏼 welcome

This is a simple corner for some words as I career shift from 10 years in corporate finance back into a life of a grad student for my second Master's degree and a career as a Psychotherapist.

The notes here will be psychological in nature and focus primarily on the intersection of Psychotherapy and Spirituality (*and by Spiritual, I mean it broadly speaking*).

You'll also find delicious little rabbit trails from current research and literature because they always grab my attention and I want to tell you about them 🤙🏼

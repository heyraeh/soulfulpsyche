### 👋🏼 welcome

heyraeh here - as I career shift back into the life of a grad student for my second Master's degree and a career as a Psychotherapist, I felt the need for a digital home while I learn and reflect.

The next few years as I go from coursework to thesis - the posts here will be psychological in nature and focus on the intersection of Psychotherapy and Spirituality (*and by Spiritual, I mean it broadly speaking*).

You'll also find some rabbit trails as I dig into current research and literature because they always grab my attention and I want to tell you about them 🤙🏼

### not sure where to start?
- read a bit 👉🏼 [[about me]]
- read some ？[[faq's]]
- look through ✏️ [[all notes]]
- read some casual words on my [Mastodon](https://mstdn.games/@craftykraken)
- or [drop me a message](tab:https://letterbird.co/heyraeh)

Otherwise, *here's what I've been writing about lately* 👇🏼

Well hey there 👋🏼

I’m Rachel (aka Soulful Psyche)

I’m on my 1100th career shift in life, from over ten years in corporate finance to Psychotherapy. This season in life has come _full circle_ as I pursue a career in Psychotherapy - that feeling where shades and nuances from previous endeavours suddenly fit in a way you didn’t think possible.

My 24/7 includes doing my second Master's (in Psychotherapy; my first Master's was in Spiritual Theology). I’m also an English Teacher for newly immigrated folks to Canada helping them feel confident in their English.

Soul Psyche is a space where you’ll find reflections on topics/themes from peer-reviewed and evidence-based literature in psychotherapy and psychology, alongside ruminations on Spirituality and the nuances of life around us. I don’t hold to any specific religion and my use of the word _Spiritual_ is wide open - so whoever you are, wherever you are from, _you are deeply welcome_. I lean Zen Buddhist, and I have spent a large portion of my life deep in Evangelical Christian worldviews for which I am always in a state of deconstructing =)

Thanks for being here, I have tea, come sit.

With love,

Rach

title: Soulful Psyche
---



I'm career shifting from 10 years in corporate finance back into grad school for my second Master's degree and a career as a Psychotherapist.

The writings here will be psychological in nature and focus primarily on the intersection of Psychotherapy and Spirituality (and by Spiritual, I mean it broadly speaking), with rabbit trails from current research and literature that strike my fancy and I want to tell you about =)

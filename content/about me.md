Why *Soulful Psyche*?
- This name simply represents the dual interest of psychology and spirituality for me. Simply put I think the compartmentalized nature of the past 100 years has done a disservice to our sense of identity and well being in the western world. As humans I believe that we are mind, body, and spirit and need to relearn what it means to have those parts of us working in unity with each other. 

What do you mean *Spirituality*?
- This is a broad definition for me and encapsulates the nuanced and intangible side of being human. Depending on your context, experiences, and cultural setting this words can be connected to an organized religion and/or a set of rituals or practices, but my use of it here is of the broader variety.

Will it be all *religion* talk here?
- No. While I will talk about spirituality (see above) my goal here is public discourse on [peer-reviewed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_review) research and discussions happening in the fields of Psychology, Psychotherapy, and Spirituality. Research done in these fields is empirically based and seeks to broaden our understanding of the mind, the psyche, and our human experience.

I don't want to feel like I'm in *school*
- You won't! I care about bringing the discourse in the research to those who aren't in these areas. The posts here will be a distillation of themes or discussions happening that catch my attention or that I feel are helpful others.
